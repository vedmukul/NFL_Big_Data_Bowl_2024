Code Description:
The code implements a Random Forest classifier from scratch using Python. It consists of two main classes: `DecisionTree` and `RandomForest`. The `DecisionTree` class represents a single decision tree and contains methods for fitting the tree to the training data and making predictions. The `RandomForest` class represents the Random Forest classifier and creates an ensemble of decision trees.

The code starts by loading and preparing the data, splitting it into training and test sets, and applying one-hot encoding and standardization to the features. Then, an instance of the Random Forest classifier is created, specifying the number of trees, maximum depth, minimum samples to split, and the number of samples for each tree (if using bootstrapping).

The Random Forest classifier is trained using the `fit` method, which fits multiple decision trees on random subsets of the training data. Predictions are made using the `predict` method, which aggregates the predictions of all decision trees in the forest.

Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, and the feature importances are computed and plotted.

Questions and Answers:

      - Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions.
      - It is known for its robustness, ability to handle high-dimensional data, and its effectiveness in capturing complex relationships between features.
      - Random Forest is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees, as it aggregates the predictions of multiple trees trained on different subsets of the data.

2. Why this specific accuracy metric?
      - Accuracy is a commonly used metric for classification problems, as it measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
      - In the code, the accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.
      - Accuracy provides an intuitive understanding of the model's performance and is suitable when the classes are balanced.

3. Why cross-validation and regularization are/aren't necessary?
      - Cross-validation is not explicitly used in the provided code. However, it can be beneficial to assess the model's performance and generalization ability by splitting the data into multiple folds and evaluating the model on each fold.
      - Regularization is not necessary for Random Forest, as it inherently reduces overfitting through the ensemble of multiple decision trees and the random selection of features at each split.

4. Which optimizations were used and why?
      - The code does not include any specific optimizations for the Random Forest classifier.
      - However, some common optimizations that could be considered are:
          - Adjusting the number of trees (`n_trees`) to balance the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency.
          - Tuning the `max_depth` parameter to control the maximum depth of each decision tree, which can help prevent overfitting.
          - Setting the `min_samples_split` parameter to determine the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, which can regulate the growth of the trees.

5. How you engineered your features:
